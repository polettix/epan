=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program helps you creating and managing an EPAN - a version of the
CPAN that is trimmed down to your needs for installing specific stuff.

To start with an example, suppose you have to install Mojolicious and
a couple of its plugins in a machine that - for good reasons - is not
connected to the Internet. It's easy to get the distribution files for
Dancer and the plugins... but what about the dependencies? It can easily
become a nightmare, forcing you to go back and forth with new modules as
soon as you discover the need to install them.

Thanks to L<cpanm>, this is quite easier these days: it can actually do
what's needed with a single command:

   # on the machine connected to the Internet or to a minicpan
   $ cpanm -L xxx --scandeps --save-dists dists \
        Mojolicious Mojolicious::Plugin::Authentication IO::Socket::SSL ...

which places all the modules in subdirectory C<dists> (thanks to option
C<--save-dists>) with an arrangement similar to what you would expect from
a CPAN mirror.

On the target machine, you still have to make some work - e.g. you should
collect the output from the invocation of cpanm above to figure out the
order to use for installing the distribution files. Additionally, the
directory structure that is generated lacks a proper index file (located
in F<modules/02package.details.txt.gz>) so it would be difficult to use
the normal toolchain.

L<epan> aims at filling up the last mile to get the job done, providing
you with a subdirectory that is ready for deployment, with all the bits in
place to push automation as much as possible. So you can do this:

   # on the machine connected to the Internet or to a minicpan
   $ epan create Mojolicious Mojolicious::Plugin::Authentication \
       IO::Socket::SSL ...
   $ tar cvzf epan.tar.gz epan

transfer C<dists.tar.gz> to the target machine and...

   # on the target machine
   $ tar xvzf epan.tar.gz
   $ cd epan
   $ ./install.sh

optionally providing an installation target directory:

   $ ./install.sh /path/to/local/perl

The program C<epan> is actually a unified access point to several
different tools for manipulating your I<exclusive Perl archive nook>. Most
of these commands operate upon a I<target directory> that is where your
EPAN is stored; this can be specified via option C<-t> or its longer
version C<--target>. By default, the target directory is assumed to be
C<epan> in the current directory.

=head2 C<add>, C<install> and C<update>

These commands are synonimous in C<epan>, and all help you pull a module
and its dependencies from a CPAN mirror right into your EPAN, regenerating
the index at the end of the process. The syntax is:

   epan add # or install or update \
      [-t|--target directory]
      Module1 [Module2...]

So, in addition to the common option C<-t> for setting the right target
directory, it accepts a list of module names to install (with their
dependencies).

=head2 C<create> 

This command is almost the same as C<add> and its aliases, with the
exception that the target directory MUST NOT already exist when called.

=head2 C<index>

Regenerate the index so that tools like C<cpanm> are happy about what they
find and treat your target directory as a real CPAN sort-of mirror. The
syntax is the following:

   epan index [-t|--target dirname]

Note that other commands (e.g. C<add> or C<create>) already do the
indexing. This command can be useful when you have a starting base (i.e.
a compound of modules coming from CPAN and your own distribution) already
arranged in the right directory tree, but you need to generate an index.
For example, this happens when you collect some distribution files using
C<cpanm>:

   shell$ cpanminus -L xxx --save-dists dists Mod1 Mod2...

because it saves the needed distributions in C<dists> but it does not
generate the index. The same happens when using C<carton>.

In these cases, if you want to prepare a pack of modules to carry with your
application, you can do like this:

   $ figure_out_modules > modlist
   $ cpanm -L xxx --save-dists dists $(<modlist)
   $ epan index -t dists
   $ tar cvf dists.tar dists

Well, put like this the second and third lines can just be synthesized as:

   $ epan add -t dists $(<modlist)

but you get the idea. The directory with the modules might be the
byproduct of invoking C<carton> instead (in which case you would end up
with a sub-directory C<cache>).

Anyway, you can then carry dists.tar with you, at which point you can:

   $ cpanm --mirror file://$YOURPATH --mirror-only Mod1 Mod2 ...

This command expects the target directory to exist and will complain
otherwise.

=head2 C<inject>

If you have some local distribution files, e.g. generated by yourself and
not (yet) uploaded to CPAN, you can inject them into a local EPAN. The
syntax is straightforward:

   epan inject \ 
      [-a|--author author-name] \
      [-t|--target dirname] File1 [File2...]

As for many other commands, you can also set the different output
filenames, but that would be hardly useful.

=head2 C<list-actions> and C<list_actions>

Prints out the list of available commands.

=head2 C<list-obsoletes> and C<list_obsoletes>

   epan list-obsoletes [-t|--target dirname]

Prints out a list of obsolete distributions in the EPAN. A distribution is
considered I<obsolete> if there is a newer corresponding version in the
EPAN. E.g. suppose that you work on C<Acme::Whatever> and inject version
C<0.2>:

   epan inject Acme-Whatever-0.2.tar.gz
   # ...

then you work on it some more time, and inject version C<0.3>:

   epan inject Acme-Whatever-0.2.tar.gz
   # ...

Now your EPAN contains two distribution packages for C<Acme::Whatever>,
one for release C<0.2> (which is the obsolete one) and one for the newest
version C<0.3>.

=head2 C<purge-obsoletes> and C<purge_obsoletes>

   epan purge-obsoletes [-t|--target dirname]

Remove (purge) obsolete distribution packages from the EPAN. See above for
what I<obsolete> means.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following options are supported, even though not all actions use them
all:

=over

=item -1 | -m | --mailrc

path to the file C<01mailrc.txt.gz>, defaults to
C<authors/01mailrc.txt.gz> inside the target directory. You hardly want to
change this.

=item -2 | -o | --output | --package-details

path to the file for C<02packages.details.txt.gz>, defaults to
C<modules/02packages.details.txt.gz> inside the target directory. Yes, you
can use C<-> with the I<usual> meaning, although this might not help you
much.

=item -3 | -l | --modlist | --modlist-data

path to the file C<03modlist.data.gz>, defaults to
C<modules/03modlist.data.gz> inside the target directory. You hardly want
to change this.

=item -a | --author author-name

module author to use when doing injection of local distribution packages.

=item --help

print a somewhat more verbose help, showing usage, this description of the
options and some examples.

=item --man

print out the full documentation for the script.

=item -t | --target dirname

set the directory of the root for the EPAN to work on. Defaults to the
sub-directory C<epan> in the current directory. This option applies to all
commands except C<list-actions>.

The default value is C<epan> as a sub-directory in the current directory.

Some commands demand that the target directory already exists; in case it
does not, they will complain that you're probably using this option in the
wrong way (or not using it at all).

=item --usage

print a concise usage line and exit.

=item --version

print the version of the script.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

epan requires no configuration files. The following environment variable
is honored:
